# WoTDL Ontology to REST

## Overview
This toolchain allows to generate REST APIs from instances of the [WoTDL OWL Ontology](https://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/projects/2019/growth/wotdl/wotdl.owl), which is part of the GrOWTH approach for Goal-Oriented End User Development for Web of Things Devices. [1] WoTDL has been listed on the [LOV4IoT Ontology Catalogue](http://lov4iot.appspot.com/?p=ontologies).

It uses a model-to-model transformation to generate an [OpenAPI](https://openapis.org) specification. 
The Flask-based REST API is generated using [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech).

## Requirements
- Python 3.7.0+
- for python requirements see requirements.txt
- openapi-generator 3.3.4+

## Usage
Get the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Adapt the IN variable to point to your ontology instance and run the model-to-model transformation:

```
python m2m_openapi.py
```

Run the model-to-text generation:

```
./m2t_openapi_flask.sh
```
