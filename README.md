# WoT Ontology to REST

## Overview
This toolchain allows to generate REST APIs from instances of the [WoT OWL Ontology](TODO), which is part of the GrOWTH approach for Goal-Oriented End User Development for Web of Things Devices. [1]

It uses a model-to-model transformation to generate an [OpenAPI](https://openapis.org) specification. 
The Flask-based REST API is generated using [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech).

## Requirements
- Python 3.7.0+
- for python requirements see requirements.txt
- openapi-generator 3.3.4+

## Usage
Get the requirements:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Adapt the IN variable to point to your ontology instance and run the model-to-model transformation:

```
python m2m_openapi.py
```

Run the model-to-text generation:

```
./m2t_openapi_flask.sh
```
